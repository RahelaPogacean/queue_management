Here I implemented a queue management system, aimed to minimize the waiting time of clients in a supermarket. The UI is divided
in few sections: so, the user enters the arrival time, service time, number of queues and the simulation interval. Then, he 
presses the button "Start Simulation" and if the entry is valid (a number greater than 1), a lot of information will be 
displayed: the actual time, the queue evolution and the simulation results. The system was implemented by using Multithreading.
